\title{Align samples across two genoprobs objects}
\usage{
genoprobs_sync_samples(genoprobs_1, genoprobs_2, sort = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs_1}{First qtl2-style genoprobs object.}

\item{genoprobs_2}{Second qtl2-style genoprobs object.}

\item{sort}{If \code{TRUE}, order common samples alphabetically.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{genoprobs_1}{First genoprobs restricted to common chromosomes and common samples.}
  \item{genoprobs_2}{Second genoprobs restricted to common chromosomes and common samples.}
  \item{common_samples}{Character vector of sample IDs in both.}
  \item{dropped_from_1}{Sample IDs only in \code{genoprobs_1}.}
  \item{dropped_from_2}{Sample IDs only in \code{genoprobs_2}.}
}
\description{
Subset both genoprobs objects to their common samples (and optionally
sort sample order). Useful before \code{genoprobs_correlate} or other
comparisons so that both objects have the same samples in the same order.
}
\details{
Only overlapping chromosomes are considered. A sample is included only if it
appears on every common chromosome in both objects. Attributes and class of
each genoprobs are preserved in the returned subsets.
