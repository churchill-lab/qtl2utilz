\title{Synchronize genoprobs to a samples data frame.}
\usage{
genoprobs_sync_samples(
  genoprobs,
  samples_df,
  sample_order = c("samples", "genoprobs", "alphabetical")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs}{qtl2-style genoprobs (named list of 3D arrays by chromosome).}

\item{samples_df}{Data frame with at least a sample ID column. Aliases are
accepted and normalized via \code{resolve_col_samples()}.}

\item{sample_order}{How to order samples in the output:
\code{'samples'} (default) preserves order from \code{samples_df},
\code{'genoprobs'} preserves order from \code{genoprobs},
\code{'alphabetical'} sorts samples alphabetically.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{genoprobs}{Genoprobs restricted to common chromosomes and
    samples present in both genoprobs and \code{samples_df}, in the
    order specified by \code{sample_order}.}
  \item{samples}{Sample data frame restricted to samples that appear in
    genoprobs; only samples present in both are included.}
  \item{common_samples}{Character vector of sample IDs present in both.}
  \item{dropped_from_genoprobs}{Sample IDs in genoprobs but not in \code{samples_df}.}
  \item{dropped_from_samples_df}{Sample IDs in \code{samples_df} but not in genoprobs.}
}
\description{
Subset and reorder genoprobs so that it contains only samples that appear
in \code{samples_df}, optionally preserving the order from either the
genoprobs object or the samples data frame. Useful to align genoprobs with
a standard sample set (e.g. for filtering to specific samples or matching
with phenotype data).
}
\details{
Only overlapping chromosomes are considered. A sample is included only if it
appears on every common chromosome in genoprobs. Attributes and class of
genoprobs are preserved in the returned subset.
