\usage{
genoprobs_combine_samples(
  genoprobs_1,
  genoprobs_2,
  samples_1 = NULL,
  samples_2 = NULL,
  sort = TRUE,
  duplicates = c("first", "error")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs_1}{First genoprobs object (list of 3D arrays by chromosome).}

\item{genoprobs_2}{Second genoprobs object (same structure as \code{genoprobs_1}).}

\item{samples_1}{Character vector of sample IDs to keep from \code{genoprobs_1};
\code{NULL} means use all samples.}

\item{samples_2}{Character vector of sample IDs to add from \code{genoprobs_2};
\code{NULL} means use all samples.}

\item{sort}{If \code{TRUE}, order the union of samples alphabetically.}

\item{duplicates}{If \code{"first"}, samples present in both are taken from
\code{genoprobs_1} and not duplicated from \code{genoprobs_2}. If
\code{"error"}, an error is raised when any sample appears in both.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{genoprobs}{Combined genoprobs object (union of samples, same chromosomes and markers).}
  \item{union_samples}{Character vector of sample IDs in the result.}
  \item{duplicates}{Character vector of sample IDs that appeared in both inputs.}
  \item{dropped_from_2_due_to_duplicates}{When \code{duplicates = "first"}, samples from \code{genoprobs_2} not added because they were already in \code{genoprobs_1}.}
  \item{added_from_2}{Sample IDs that came from \code{genoprobs_2} only.}
}
\description{
Combine two qtl2-style genoprobs objects by taking the union of samples.
Chromosomes, founder/strain names, and marker names must match exactly
between the two objects. Useful for merging genoprobs from the same
cross computed in separate batches or from different marker sets that
have been synchronized first.
}
\details{
Chromosome sets must be identical (same names). For each chromosome, founder
names (columns) and marker names (third dimension) must match. Attributes and
class of the result are taken from \code{genoprobs_1}.
