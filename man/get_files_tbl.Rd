\title{Get files in a directory matching a pattern.}
\usage{
get_files_tbl(directory, file_pattern)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{Directory to search for files.}

\item{file_pattern}{Regular expression pattern to match file names (also
used to derive sample_id from basename).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
  \item{sample_id}{Character; derived by removing \code{file_pattern} from
    the file basename.}
  \item{full_path}{Character; full path to each file.}
  \item{file_name}{Character; basename of each file.}
}
\description{
Recursively finds all files under \code{directory} whose names match
\code{file_pattern}. Extracts \code{sample_id} by stripping the pattern from
the basename (assumes sample ID is the part before the pattern). Used
internally by \code{gbrs_find_files}; not exported.
