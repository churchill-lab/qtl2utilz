\title{Interpolate genoprobs to a new marker map}
\usage{
genoprobs_interpolate(probs1, markers1, markers2)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs1}{qtl2-style genoprobs: named list of 3D arrays (samples x
founders x markers), one element per chromosome.}

\item{markers1}{qtl2-style marker map for \code{probs1}: named list of
named numeric vectors (marker positions), names = chromosome and marker.}

\item{markers2}{qtl2-style marker map to interpolate onto: same list
structure; \code{probs1} will be interpolated to these positions.}
}
\value{
A genoprobs object with the same structure and attributes as
  \code{probs1}, but with marker sets (and third dimension) from
  \code{markers2} for each chromosome.
}
\description{
Given qtl2-style genotype probabilities and their marker map, interpolate
the probabilities onto a second marker map (e.g. from MUGA or a different
array). Linear interpolation in base-pair position is used per chromosome.
If marker positions are in Mb (max < 200), they are converted to bp
internally.
}
\details{
\code{probs1} and \code{markers1} must have the same length (chromosomes).
For each chromosome, \code{interpolate_chromosome} is called. Attributes
(\code{crosstype}, \code{is_x_chr}, \code{alleles}, \code{alleleprobs}) and
class are copied from \code{probs1}.
