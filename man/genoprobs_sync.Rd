\title{Synchronize genoprobs with samples and/or markers data frames.}
\usage{
genoprobs_sync(
  genoprobs,
  samples_df = NULL,
  markers_df = NULL,
  sample_order = c("samples", "genoprobs", "alphabetical"),
  unit = c("auto", "Mb", "bp")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs}{qtl2-style genoprobs (named list of 3D arrays by chromosome).}

\item{samples_df}{Optional data frame with sample IDs. If provided, genoprobs
will be synchronized to samples in this data frame. Aliases are accepted
and normalized via \code{resolve_col_samples()}.}

\item{markers_df}{Optional data frame with marker information. If provided,
genoprobs will be synchronized to markers in this data frame. Aliases are
accepted and normalized via \code{resolve_col_markers()}.}

\item{sample_order}{How to order samples when \code{samples_df} is provided:
\code{'samples'} (default) preserves order from \code{samples_df},
\code{'genoprobs'} preserves order from \code{genoprobs},
\code{'alphabetical'} sorts samples alphabetically.}

\item{unit}{Position unit for markers: \code{'auto'} (detect from values),
\code{'Mb'}, or \code{'bp'}. Only used when \code{markers_df} is provided.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
  \item{genoprobs}{Genoprobs synchronized to samples and/or markers as specified.}
  \item{samples}{If \code{samples_df} was provided: sample data frame restricted
    to samples present in genoprobs.}
  \item{markers}{If \code{markers_df} was provided: marker data frame restricted
    to markers present in genoprobs, sorted by chr/pos.}
  \item{map}{If \code{markers_df} was provided: qtl2-style marker map.}
  \item{common_samples}{If \code{samples_df} was provided: character vector of
    sample IDs present in both.}
  \item{dropped_from_genoprobs_samples}{If \code{samples_df} was provided:
    sample IDs in genoprobs but not in \code{samples_df}.}
  \item{dropped_from_samples_df}{If \code{samples_df} was provided: sample IDs
    in \code{samples_df} but not in genoprobs.}
  \item{dropped_markers_not_in_gp}{If \code{markers_df} was provided:
    per-chromosome list of marker IDs in \code{markers_df} but not in genoprobs.}
  \item{dropped_markers_not_in_map}{If \code{markers_df} was provided:
    per-chromosome list of marker IDs in genoprobs but not in \code{markers_df}.}
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper that synchronizes genoprobs to samples and/or markers
data frames in a single call. Calls \code{genoprobs_sync_samples()} and/or
\code{genoprobs_sync_markers()} internally, applying them in sequence.
}
\details{
When both \code{samples_df} and \code{markers_df} are provided, samples are
synchronized first, then markers. This ensures the final genoprobs object
contains only the intersection of samples and markers specified.
