\title{Rank-based inverse normal transformation.}
\usage{
rankZ(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector; \code{NA}s are preserved.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}; \code{NA} where
  \code{x} was \code{NA}, otherwise normal quantiles.
}
\description{
Converts a numeric vector to approximate normality using ranks. Ranks are
scaled to (0, 1) and passed through \code{\link[stats]{qnorm}}. Useful for
transforming skewed expression or phenotype data before QTL mapping.
