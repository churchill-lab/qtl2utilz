\title{Build expression matrix from GBRS read-counts files.}
\usage{
gbrs_build_counts(gbrs_files_tbl)
}
\arguments{
\item{gbrs_files_tbl}{Tibble from \code{gbrs_find_files} with columns
\code{sample_id} and \code{full_path_counts}.}
}
\value{
A matrix with rows = samples (rownames = sample IDs) and columns =
  genes (locus IDs). Values are total expected read counts.
}
\description{
Reads GBRS expected read-counts TSV files (one per sample), verifies that
all samples have identical locus IDs in the same order, then combines
\code{total} counts into a matrix with samples as rows and genes (loci)
as columns. Expects \code{gbrs_files_tbl} from \code{gbrs_find_files}.
